# Home Screen 
This homescreen design is a layout of what the homescreen of both the math and non-math game should look like before the games are actually played. Although this homescreen is unable to actually conncet to the games created, the original concept was to have the homescreen with 2 buttons (one for math game and one for non-math game) and when one button is clicked by a mouse, would lead to the game created using a 'thread'. 



# Math Game:  
To play Math Game, use mouse and click in the center of the game screen to proceed to the game. 
A multiplication question will be provided in the top center of the screen and four answers located on a coloured rectangle (blue, yellow, green or red) will be provided below the question. 
Select the correct answer to the corresponding math problem by pressing on the rectangle with the approprate answer. 
IF the answer you have selected is correct, another math problem will be asked. 
IF you have incorrectly answered the math problem, you will be taken back to the homescreen to restart the game. 



# Non-Math Game:  
To play the Non-Math game, use your mouse to control which way your zapper will go by dragging your mouse to the right or left. 
Five tires (ellipses) will have alrealy appeared on the screen. In order to eliminate (zap) the tires to win the game, drag the zapper (rectangle) accross the screen and click the mouse to shoot a lazer beam towards the tires. 
Once all 5 tires have been 'zapped' a sentence saying: 'You have completed your task' will appear in the center of your screen and your score (500 points) will appear on the botton right corner of the game screen.
